# psytrance-new-releases
Scrape everynoise.com new releases for psytrance

I am creating this relatively simple app with node.js and trying out both `puppeteer` and `playwright` to see which one I like better. Ultimately, this project helps me learn to program as well as the Dev Ops that go along with modern web projects.

## Dev Ops

If you have come across this repo, you will notice it looks like a pile of shit made from code, `npm_modules` and online IDE config files. As I develop this project, I have been trying to get it running on different online IDEs and any other service I know of that could host it for free. 

There are so many nuances that vary from service to service. Itâ€™s actually been amazing how difficult it is to get the same code to run on multiple services. Particularly difficult is getting a headless version of Chromium running in order to do web scraping with `puppeteer` and `playwright`. 

I have learned a wealth of knowledge by problem solving solutions for getting this tiny project running. I will post active links to the services here when I complete this.
